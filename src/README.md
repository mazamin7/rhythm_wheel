This project is developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We use the following open source libraries:
-Vue.js
-Tone.js
-BootstrapVue
-Firestore

MAIN FEATURES
-The user can choose the number of beats/steps for each ring.
-A step can be stressed or unstressed (support for accents).

-The user can change the color of the rings. Stressed beats are characterized by a darker colour.
-The user can select the musical instrument thanks to a drop-down menu.
-There's a big collection of instrument samples.
-For each ring it is possible to change the phase delay (steer the ring).
-The user can set the volume of each ring and the RPM with the dedicated sliders.
-The user can save and load rhythmic patterns.
-The application can generate a random pattern.

Click once again to mark the step as accented.
Click one more time and itâ€™s removed.
